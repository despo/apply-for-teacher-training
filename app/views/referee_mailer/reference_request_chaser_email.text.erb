Dear <%= @reference.name %>,

# Give a reference for <%= @candidate_name %> as soon as possible

We have not had your reference for <%= @candidate_name %>. They put us in touch with you to get a reference for their teacher training application. They applied to:

<% @application_form.application_choices.each do |application_choice| %>
* <%= application_choice.course_option.provider.name %> - <%= application_choice.course_option.course.name %>
<% end %>

Give a reference as soon as possible by filling in this short form (it does not take long):

<%= referee_interface_reference_relationship_url(token: @token) %>

Teacher training places can become full at any time. The sooner <%= @candidate_name %> gets a reference, the more likely it is that they’ll get a place.

Let us know as soon as possible if you will not give a reference:

<%= referee_interface_refuse_feedback_url(token: @token) %>

# Your data

We’ll only use your data to process the candidate’s application, unless you agree to be contacted by us about your experience of giving a reference. We’ll ask about this before you submit any information.
