Dear <%= @name %>

# Will you not give <%= @candidate_name %> a reference?

Let us know if you will not give a reference:

<%= referee_interface_refuse_feedback_url(token: @token) %>

Otherwise, give a reference as soon as possible:

<%= referee_interface_reference_relationship_url(token: @token) %>

# Your data

We’ll only use your data to process the candidate’s application, unless you agree to be contacted by us about your experience of giving a reference. We’ll ask about this before you submit any information.
