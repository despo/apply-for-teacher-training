      The Apply sandbox is a test environment which allows you to experience the service as a candidate, training provider and software vendor.
    </p>

    <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>You can:</h2>

    <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
      <li>sign in as a candidate and submit an application</li>
      <li>sign in as a training provider and process an application</li>
      <li>test Apply’s <%= govuk_link_to 'API integrations', 'https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/api-docs' %></li>
    </ul>

    <p class='govuk-body'>Throughout, you’ll be able to give us feedback so we can improve the service.</p>

    <h2 class='govuk-heading-l'>Get started as a candidate</h2>

    <p class='govuk-body'>You’ll be asked to enter your email address to open a candidate account in the Apply sandbox.</p>

    <p class='govuk-body'>Please do not use anybody else’s address, as the system will generate real emails as part of the test.</p>

    <p class='govuk-body'>Any other data you enter should be anonymised or invented.</p>

    <h4 class='govuk-heading-s'>A note on references</h4>

    <p class='govuk-body'>In the live service, an application is only sent to a provider when 2 references have been supplied.</p>

    <p class='govuk-body'>In the Apply sandbox, to avoid testers having to request real references, we’ve enabled dummy referee email addresses:</p>

    <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
      <li>refbot1@example.com</li>
      <li>refbot2@example.com</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='govuk-body'>In sandbox, enter these email addresses to generate 2 references for your test application.</p>

    <h4 class='govuk-heading-s'>A note on editing after submission</h4>

    <p class='govuk-body'>In the live service, applications are sent to the provider 5 working days after submission. This gives candidates a window to edit their application.</p>

    <p class='govuk-body'>In the Apply sandbox, applications are sent immediately, if the references are complete.</p>

    <h2 class='govuk-heading-l'>Get started as a training provider</h2>
