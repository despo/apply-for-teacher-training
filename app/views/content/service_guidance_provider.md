Thank you for signing up to the Department for Education’s Manage teacher training applications service.

The service is now being rolled out to training providers throughout England. By October 2021, all teacher training applications will be made through [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk) and processed through [Manage teacher training applications](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider).

Until that date, Apply for teacher training will run alongside UCAS Teacher Training. You’ll find more information about the dual running of the services in [Deadlines and terms of use](#deadlines-and-terms-of-use) and [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

We’ll continue to make improvements to the service as we roll out. We’ll keep you informed of new features with our newsletter, which is sent out to all onboarded providers.

##<a name="what-you-can-expect-from-us"></a>What you can expect from us

###Support for training providers

You can contact us with problems or questions at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk>.

Our dedicated training provider support team will respond to urgent queries within 1 working day, and non-urgent queries within 5 working days.

###Support for candidates

Our support team is also on hand to guide candidates through the application process and help with any technical issues they may have when using the service.

We prioritise as urgent any problems preventing application submission.

###Fees

Apply and Manage are free services for both candidates and providers.

###Still to come: fraud and plagiarism checks

For now, we don't provide fraud and plagiarism checks on candidate applications.

##<a name="onboarding"></a>Onboarding

Onboarding is quick and easy, usually taking place over a single working day.

1. We’ll ask for contact details for your admissions team so we can add them to [Manage teacher training applications](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider) as admin users. We’ll also ask you for the names of any other organisations you partner with – for example, accredited bodies who ratify your courses.

2. Taking data from [Publish teacher training courses](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/), we’ll upload your courses to Manage teacher training applications.

3. We’ll then update [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) so that candidates know they can apply for your courses through [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/candidate).

4. We’ll ask you to sign a data-sharing agreement and create a DfE Sign-in account (if you don’t already have one).

5. You’ll then be able to view and process applications from your Manage teacher training applications dashboard.

We’re available to give you full support at every stage.

##<a name="using-the-service"></a>Using the service
[Manage teacher training applications](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider) allows you to process applications from submission through to offer.

###Viewing applications

Users with access to the Manage service will be able to view applications to courses you run as a training provider or ratify as an accredited provider.

###Filtering applications

You can filter applications by candidate name, application status, training provider and ratifying provider.

###Making decisions on applications

Users in your team will be able to:

* make an offer
* set conditions
* offer a different course, location or provider
* withdraw
* reject, with reasons

###Email alerts

You'll receive an email every time an application's status changes, for example from 'Offer' to 'Offer accepted'.

###Notes

Notes allow you and your colleagues to add extra information or points to consider to individual applications. Notes are not seen by the candidate.

###Timeline

Individual applications also come with a time-stamped audit trail recording what decisions have been made, when and by whom.

###Downloading and printing

You can download and print applications to distribute to your team. Compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is your responsibility.

###Still to come: interviews

For now, interview scheduling is not part of the Manage service.

##<a name="deadlines-and-terms-of-use"></a>Deadlines and terms of use

For clarity and fairness, while Apply for teacher training and UCAS Teacher Training run side by side (until October 2021), we’ve kept the rules governing applications closely aligned.

###Reject by default and decline by default deadlines

Training providers have 40 working days to respond to an application (starting from the date when references have been submitted).

Candidates have 10 working days to accept or reject offer(s) (starting from the date when all their training providers have responded to their application).

As currently, the reject by default deadline changes over the summer. In 2020, for all applications received between 1 July and 3 October, providers have 20 working days to respond before the application is automatically rejected.

###Changing the terms of an offer

Up until the point a candidate accepts your offer, you can change the course, location, training provider and conditions of the offer.

Once they’ve accepted your offer, you can’t change these things without their permission.

###Apply again (Apply 2)

Candidates can now use [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/candidate) to apply again if they are rejected by all their providers, or decline by default or withdraw their applications.

In UCAS this phase is called ‘Apply 2’. Our data shows that 70% of candidates do not enter Apply 2. By creating a more supportive user journey, we hope to see greater numbers of candidates reapply.

We’ve made it easier for providers to give helpful feedback to candidates, and we’re allowing candidates to edit and improve previous applications.

As currently, in this phase candidates can make an unlimited number of single, sequential applications, until they accept an offer, or the application cycle for the academic year closes. Providers still have 40 days to respond to each application.

Candidates will also be able to use UCAS’s Apply 2 service for this part of their journey.


##<a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

###Informing candidates your courses are on Apply

Your courses will automatically be uploaded to [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk) as part of our onboarding process.

When candidates use [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) and select one of your courses, they will have the option to continue via Apply for teacher training. (They will also be able to apply via UCAS, if you’ve decided to keep your courses listed on both services.)

When candidates bypass [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) and come directly to Apply for teacher training via a search engine or a provider website, they will also be offered a choice between Apply and UCAS.

###Stopping candidates making multiple applications through Apply and UCAS

We are developing data sharing arrangements with UCAS to monitor candidates who attempt to:

* apply to the same course twice (by using both the Apply and UCAS services)
* apply to more than 3 courses in the Apply 1 stage of their application (by using both the Apply and UCAS services)

###Helping candidates apply to training providers not yet onboarded to Manage teacher training applications

Non-onboarded training providers continue to be available through UCAS Teacher Training. This will remain the case until the UCAS service is switched off in October 2021.

We provide a clear route to UCAS for candidates who choose non-onboarded providers:

1. When candidates select a non-onboarded provider in [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/), they will be directed to UCAS, just as they always have been.

2. When candidates select an onboarded provider in [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/), they are given a choice about which service to use.

3. We suggest candidates use Apply for teacher training if all their chosen training providers are available through the service and they are interested in becoming an early adopter. We suggest candidates use UCAS Teacher Training if they’ve already started applying via UCAS, or some of their chosen training providers are not available through Apply for teacher training.

4. Within [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk), if candidates select a non-onboarded provider as one of their additional course choices, they are directed back to UCAS to apply using that service.

###Onboarding for providers with courses ratified by an accredited body

If your courses are ratified by an accredited body, or you are part of a partnership of teacher training organisations, you will need to make sure your partners are ready to be onboarded to Manage.

They may find our [introduction to the service](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider) helpful. We’re available to answer any questions they may have on <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk>.

###Candidates who apply for your courses through UCAS

Candidates are given a choice about which service to use to apply for your courses. It’s important that you continue to check UCAS for candidates applying via that service. You’ll need to process these applications through UCAS in the normal way.

###COVID-19

The Department for Education has not changed delivery timetables for the roll-out of the Apply and Manage services.

For questions related to COVID-19, please email our dedicated helpline on <dfe.coronavirushelpline@education.gov.uk> or call us at <a href="tel:0800 046 8687">0800 046 8687</a>.
Lines are open 8am to 6pm (Monday to Friday) 10am to 4pm (Saturday and Sunday).

##<a name="publicising-apply"></a>Publicising Apply for teacher training

Some providers find that becoming an early adopter of a streamlined, modern GOV.UK service is a useful marketing aid.

You can direct candidates to the new service by linking from your website to your listings page on [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/).

Our [marketing tool kit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dCZ5HF_mpJMAOpmr305VqlUo_wqW2jWmzOWi9vxStI0/edit#slide=id.g73a2eda7b8_0_40) may be helpful for your website and social media feeds.
