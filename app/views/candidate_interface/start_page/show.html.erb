    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What youâ€™ll need</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      To be eligible for teacher training, you need these qualifications (or their non-UK equivalents):
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a degree</li>
      <li>grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSEs</li>
      <li>grade 4 (C) or above in GCSE science if you want to teach primary</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Before you start a teacher training course, your training provider will usually send you a health questionnaire to complete. This confirms you have the fitness and physical capacity to start training.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have a disability</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">It is against the law for training providers to discriminate against teacher training candidates with disabilities or special educational needs. <%= govuk_link_to 'Learn more about training to teach if you have a disability', 'https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-teach-with-a-disability' %>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you do not have a degree</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can teach in further education (age 14 to adult), or study for a degree leading to qualified teacher status.
