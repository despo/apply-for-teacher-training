# References

We’ve emailed your referees and will send them a reminder in <%= (TimeLimitConfig.chase_referee_by - 2) %> working days.

Your application will not be considered without references. Courses can become full at any time - keep in touch with your referees to ensure they give a reference as soon as possible.

# Application decision

If your training provider decides to progress your application, they’ll contact you directly to organise an interview date.

<% if FeatureFlag.active?('covid_19') %>
Due to the impact of coronavirus, it might take some time for providers to get back to you.
<% else %>
They should make a decision on whether to make an offer within <%= TimeLimitConfig.limits_for(:reject_by_default).first.limit %> working days of receiving your application.
<% end %>
