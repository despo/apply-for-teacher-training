Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Give a new referee as soon as possible

We have not had a reference from <%= @referee.name %> yet.

Add a new referee:

<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>

If you know <%= @referee.name %> is planning on giving a reference, you can keep chasing them instead. The email may have gone to junk or spam.

We cannot send applications to teacher training providers without 2 references. Courses can become full at any time - get your reference as soon as possible.
