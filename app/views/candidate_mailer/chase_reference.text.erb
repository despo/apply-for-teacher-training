Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Get in contact with <%= @reference.name %> as soon as possible

<%= @reference.name %> has not given you a reference yet.

Ask them to check their inbox including their junk or spam emails and give a reference as soon as possible.

# Check youâ€™ve given the right details

You gave us this email address:

<%= @reference.email_address %>

If this is not correct, cancel the reference request and add in the referee details again:

<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>

We cannot send applications to teacher training providers without 2 references. Courses can become full at any time - get your reference as soon as possible.
