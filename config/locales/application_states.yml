        When a candidate has filled in their email address, they’ve started

      name: Offer made
      description: |
        The provider has made an offer to the candidate. The candidate has to accept
        or reject the offer, which sets the application status to ‘Pending
        conditions’.

        We assume that all offers have some conditions, even if there
        are no academic conditions.

    enrolled:
      name: Candidate enrolled
      description: |
        Once the candidate has completed the enrolment process, the provider confirms
        their enrolment onto the training programme. Since this status would be used
        to claim bursaries/grants from DfE, the provider may delay enrolling the trainee
        until a few weeks after the start of the training, since trainees can still
        not show up on the first day or drop out within the first couple of weeks.
        This reduces the risk that DfE over-pays that provider for training they didn’t
        deliver and has to reconcile later on.

        The candidate’s HESA equality monitoring information is made available to the provider.

        candidates must pass a DBS & childen’s barred list check, and
        candidates must pass a fitness to work health check.

        An email is sent to the candidate, the content of which depends
